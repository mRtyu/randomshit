title: Why am I like this?

I don't trust the thoughts that come inside my head

I don't trust this thing that beats inside my chest

Who I am and who I wanna be cannot connect


I push away the people that I love the most

I don't want no one to know I'm vulnerable

That makes me feel weak and so uncomfortable


WHY?
