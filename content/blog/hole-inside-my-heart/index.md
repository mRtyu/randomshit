title: Hole Inside My Heart

What if who I hoped to be was always me?
And the love I fought to feel was always free?
What if all the things I've done,
Were just attempts at earning love?
'Cause the hole inside my heart is stupid deep

What if where I've tried to go was always here?
And the path I've tried to cut was always clear?
Why has life become a plan,
To put some money in my hand?
When the love I really need is stupid cheap
